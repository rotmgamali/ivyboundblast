# OmniBot Email System

## Who We Target

We run cold email campaigns to three groups:

1. **Public School Administrators** — Principals, superintendents, curriculum directors
2. **Real Estate Investors** — People who recently purchased properties  
3. **Political Donors** — Business professionals who contribute to political causes

## How It Works

### Step 1: Find Leads
We gather contact information for people in each target group.

### Step 2: Research Each Person
For every lead, we scrape their website or search online to find personalization details:
- Recent news about their school or company
- Property information they purchased
- Their professional background and interests

### Step 3: Write Personalized Emails
Using AI, we write custom emails for each person based on what we learned. No two emails are the same.

### Step 4: Send Email Sequence + Follow-Up Call
Each person receives **3 emails** followed by a phone call:

| Step | Timing | What Happens |
|------|--------|--------------|
| **Email 1** | Day 0 | Introduce yourself, show you researched them |
| **Email 2** | Day 4 | Follow up with something valuable |
| **Email 3** | Day 11 | Final friendly check-in |
| **Genelle Call** | Day 12 | Personal phone call to follow up on the emails |

## The Result

Every lead gets a personalized outreach sequence that feels like someone actually took the time to learn about them — because the system did.
